# World_Weather_Analysis
Project Overview

We were given the following tasks to create a algorithm where users can search for their dream vacation spots by searching temperatures and hotels in that city.

Determine the most suitable temperatures of popular vacation spots.
Determine the latitudes and longitudes of cities all over the map.
Create graphs of multiple data points, such as temperatures, wind speed, and cloudiness.
Create a tool where users can click on a city and relevant information will be revealed, such as temperature, cloudiness, humidity, and hotels nearby.

Results & Summary

From our graphs and data frame, we concluded that users like convenience. Having one single tool that will provide everything they need will increase their satisfaction and they will more likely use again in their future trips. Our culture of getting things as quickly and effeciently as possible makes drawing critical information from API a very necessary thing. As long as we save our customers time and energy when obtaining information they need, customer retention will remain high.
